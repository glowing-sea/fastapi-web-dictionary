I have fixed some bugs in your previous implementations. You need to implement some new features.

(1) In dictionary search, if a word has been favoured, there should be a Note panel on top of any following definitions, like in the vocabulary section. User can also save note within that section. The button should show it is favoured or not.

(2) In vocabulary, it should support deleting all words. Also it should also support importing or export vocabulary in JSON, storing both the word and notes. When importing, if a word already exist, the note should be rewritten by the notes of the word that is imported.

(3) When I select a word in history tab or vocabulary tab, I should be able to select this word by clicking the panel holding it. Currently I have to click the word itself, which is inconvenient.

Please use the new code I uploaded to modify directly, it is already significantly different from what you have locally. 
After changing the bugs mentioned, return me a new zip code.
